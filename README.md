My Ansible files
================

This are the Ansible files (my own PlayBook) I use when I change my dedicated server company (this happens frequently, yes...). I've executed those files successfully on Ubuntu machines (only).

Actually, it's not a complete list of what I do, but I'll try to keep it up-to-date, and fill with more things.

Feel free to use anything you need :)

```
export ANSIBLE_HOSTS=/{PATH_TO_PROJECT}/hosts
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
